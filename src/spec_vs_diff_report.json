  "summary": "The diff successfully implements both REQ-7 and REQ-8. A ContactSection component was added to the homepage with email, phone, address, and social media links using IPL-themed design. A WelcomeModal component was created that appears on first visit, collects name/email/phone, uses localStorage to prevent repeated displays, and includes a close button. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
